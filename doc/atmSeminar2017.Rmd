# Example of ATM Question Requiring Counterfactuals
* Consider situations that required a GDP
* Can we statistically quantify resulting outcomes without GDP
* __How much airborne delay if GDP is not implemented?__
* Causal Inference methods can help estimate this counterfactual
    * Machine Learning enables flexible and scalable modeling 

# Other domains have applied causal inference
* ``How does a job training program affect salaries?"
* ``How does smoking cessation counseling affect mortality?"
* ``Is an ISP violating Net Neutrality?"
* Commonality: Many important applications are not amenable to a Randomized Control Trial (RCT)

# A statistical framework: Rubin potential outcomes
* ${X,Y,T}=$ {Predictors, Outcome, Treatment indicator}
* Each unit has a potential outcome:
    * $Y_i(T_i=0)$ and $Y_i(T_i=1)$
    * But only one is observed: either $T_i=1$ or $T_i=0$!
* In a RCT: $T_i$ would be randomized, so...
    * Average Treatment Effect (ATE): $E[Y(1)-Y(0)]$
    * Estimate ATE simply by: $1/N\sum{Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)}$
    * This works since random assignment balances covariates of treatment and control groups
    
    

# The fundamental issue: counterfactuals must be estimated
* Many studies are Observational
    * units are not assigned randomly to treatment/control group
* Confounding: some predictors determine outcome and treatment assignment
    * Difference in covariates between treatment and control group can be statisticaly significant
* Assumption: Treatment assignment $T$ indep. of potential outcomes $Y$ given $X$
* Challenge: Covariate space dim$(X)$ can be large
    * How do you match on a vector $X_i$ to simulate a counteractual from the other group?
* Key result: $\pi_i=P(T_i|X_i)$ is a (scalar) **balancing score**

#  Simplified recipe for propensity score analysis

* Estimation of counterfactual:
    * Compute/Model $\pi_i$ so that $X_i$ are balanced like an RCT
    * Weight outcomes: $w_i=\frac{T_i}{\pi_i}+\frac{1-T_i}{1-\pi_i}$  
    * Assess effect with outcome regression on treatment indicator just like RCT

* Required ingredients:
    * Propensity score models for $\pi_i=P(T_i|X_i)$
    * Balance assesment metrics: SMD or KS statistic
    * Outcome estimators: 

$\quad\quad\quad \hat{\mu}_{IPW}=\frac{\sum_i \frac{T_i}{\pi_i}Y_i}{\sum_i \frac{T_i}{\pi_i}}$

#An intial application: Airborne Delay at JFK from GDP

* How would average hourly airbone delay change if a GDP was not applied at JFK?
* Unit of analysis (i): arrival hour at JFK (7102; Sep 2013-Aug 2014)
* Covariates (X): Hourly (forecasted) weather and traffic 
* Treatment (T): Hour is treated (GDP) or in control (no GDP)
* Outcome (Y): Average hourly airborne delay 
* Data snapshot - (mostly) publicly available in ASPM:

# Data manipulation and alignment

* Analysis requires hourly TAF, ASPM (various modules), TFMI  
* ASPM has hourly values for average airborne delay
* Queue length from ASPM is 15-min based
    * Arrival Demand - Effective Arrivals
* TAF is (nominally) generated for 0,6,12,18h 
* TFMI is event based 
  * GDP initations (root advisories) can be modified
  * Must follow the sub time-series to get actual start/stop times
  * End-result is 'status' of each hour (GDP or No-GDP)

# Propensity Score for balancing imbalanced groups
* Recall definition of PS: $$\pi_i = P(T_i=1|X_i)$$
* Used to balance treatment and control groups, which are imbalanced across covariates

covariate   | E(Y1;t=1) | E(Y0;t=0) | p|
------------|------|------|-------:|
qlength     | 53.6 | 2.3  | 0.00   |
arrivals    | 34.8 | 21.9 | 0.00   | 
visibility  | 7.7 | 9.3   | 0.00   |

#Propensity Score modeling of binary treatments
* Parametric estimation of propensity score: Linear Logistic regression 

$$\mathtt{logit}(\hat{\pi_i})=\frac{P(T_i=1|X_i)}{1-P(T_i=1|X_i)}=F(X_i) = \beta X_i$$

* GBM (using __t__ trees) is often better (more flexible and robust) than linear logistic regression

$$F(X_i) = \sum_k^t f_k(X_i)$$ 


# What is a GBM tree?
* A Tree is like a multi-dimensional step-function ~ decision tree

* graphic from xgboost: https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tqchen/pdf/BoostedTree.pdf

# Fitting GBM: penalized loss and additive training 
* GBM model based on objective: loss (Bernoulli) and penalty
$$\sum_i^n \ell(T_i,\hat{\pi_i})+ \sum_k^t\Omega(f_k)$$

* Bernoulli loss: $$\ell_i = T_i \ln \hat{\pi_i} + (1-T_i) \ln (1-\hat{\pi_i})$$
* Penalize lots of leaves and large weights: $$\Omega_k = \gamma L_k + \lambda \sum_j^{L_k} w_j^2$$

* Solution: Additive Training (Boosting)

* The best GBM model for the PS is not the most accurate predictor of GDP, but one that achieves best covariate balance!

# Outcome Analysis to estimate ATT
* Those weights which achieve best balance can now be used in weighted linear regression on treatment
* Average Treatment Effect for Treated (ATT) $$=E(Y1|t=1)-E(Y1|t=0)$$
* For this analysis (unit of analysis = hour): 
__had a GDP not been applied to the hours at JFK when it in fact was, the hourly average airborne delay would increase on average by 1.4 minutes__
* This result was not statistically significant (std error of same magnitude)
* Let's consider alternative analysis options: unit of analysis; outcomes; binary vs continous treatment

# Near term refinements of this simplified analysis
* Unit of analysis may interact: adjacent hours likely to be treated
* Hourly average airborne delay is based on ETE: schedule padding
* Alternative: use individual flight data (not public)
    * consider single origin: e.g. LAX to JFK to avoid estimating __nominal__ ETE
    * outcome is now actual time enroute between treated/controls
* At individual flight level, treatment is not binary, but continuous (ground-delay) 
    * requires Generalized Propensity score to estimate dose-response curve (dose: ground delay; response: airborne delay)
    * compare to simulated queueing models of airbone delay
* How to account for possible additional TFMI incurred by GDP delayed flights? (conjectered by Billimoria, 2016)


# Some concluding remarks and future research options

* Casual inference/propensity score modeling is worth investigating further for ATM counterfactual estimation
* Propensity score analysis provides advantages over regression-based techniques:
    * dimensional reduction
    * grounded in rigorous statistical framework
    * robust again model mis-specification
    * avoids extrapolation
    * seperates covariate balancing from outcome analysis

* Our simplified (binary treatment) analysis focused on GDP; 
    * could consider individual flights with continous treatments
    * account for pre-treatment covariates such as weather/traffic at nearby airports (NY metro)
* Consider other TFMI (e.g. Reroutes) in potential outcomes frameworks; requires examining relevant covariates (e.g. convective cloud top altitude)
