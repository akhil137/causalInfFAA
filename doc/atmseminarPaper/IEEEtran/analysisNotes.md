flights with edct do have additional airborne delay (~4mins at JFK using ASPM2015; similar for 2014 and 2013).

their concluision is: 
"indicating that some of these flights may have been subjected to other TMIs in addition to a ground hold at the departure airport"

#look at control group flights with largest (say 75th percentile) abdelay (for counterfactual) and look at which features are qualitatively different than the rest of that population.  Are those features more simlar to the treatment group.
