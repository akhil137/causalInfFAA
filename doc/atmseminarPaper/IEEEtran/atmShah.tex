\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
   \graphicspath{{./figs/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
We propose that techniques from Causal Inference can be used to statistically estimate counterfactual outcomes, by definition never observable, of Air Traffic Flow Management Initiatives (ATFMI), as a novel means to aid Air Traffic Management (ATM) decision-making.  Specifically, we apply the method of Propensity Scores to estimate the average counterfactual outcome (i.e. airborne delay) of not applying a Ground Delay Program (GDP) to flights that were observed to be delayed under a GDP.   In addition to summarizing the concepts of Causal Inference and Propensity scores, we empirically demonstrate a propensity score weighting method on a FAA dataset of roughly 18,000 flights arriving into JFK airport during July 2014.  The estimated propensity score model allows us to weight weather and traffic features to properly compare airborne delay experienced between flights subject to a GDP and those which were not.  Furthermore we introduce a new metric, capacity-adjusted airborne delay, which we argue should be used to quantify the outcome of a GDP.  Future extensions of our proof-of-concept application of causal inference to ATM, some of which are underway, are also discussed.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
%The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is the governmental agency responsible for policy and oversight of air transportation in the United States.  Many day-to-day Air Traffic Management (ATM) decisions are made by the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC), which has ``final approval authority for all national traffic management initiatives."  The ATCSCC implements its authority by publishing timely Air Traffic Flow Management Initiatives (ATFMI), regularly consulting with Airline Operation Centers (AOC) using a process known as Collaborative Decision Making.   

%Both the ATCSCC and AOC regularly implement ATFMI, such as Ground Delay Programs (GDP), which purposefully delay flights on the ground at the departure airport to avoid more costly and less safe airborne delays at the arrival airport.  Other examples of ATFMI include Ground Stops and Reroutes\footnote{More examples of ATFMI and detailed descriptions can be found in \cite{faatfm}.}.  These initiatives increase the safety and efficiency of the nation's air transportation system, for example replacing airborne delay with ground delay, and are necessary during inclement weather and in other situations where demand exceeds various capacities, such as airport arrival capacity.  The complexity of optimally allocating constrained resources have motivated researchers to develop decision making aids, for example \cite{pyrgiotis2011public}, that can assist operators to evaluate tradeoffs of available ATFMI.

Improvements in Air Traffic Management (ATM) require accurate performance measurements or estimates of Traffic Flow Management Initiatives (TFMI).  Traffic managers at the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) and other stakeholders, such the Airlines Operations Centers (AOC), should be able to estimate potential impacts on performance metrics, such as ground and airborne delays, due to various courses of actions.  Both the ATCSCC and AOC regularly implement  Traffic Flow Management Initiatives (TFMI), such as Ground Delay Programs (GDP), which purposefully delay flights on the ground at the departure airport to avoid more costly and less safe airborne delays at the arrival airport.  Other examples of TFMI include Ground Stops and Reroutes\footnote{More examples of TFMI and detailed descriptions can be found in \cite{faatfm}.}.  TFMI are meant to increase the safety and efficiency of the nation's air transportation system, for example replacing airborne delay with ground delay, and are necessary during inclement weather and in other situations where demand exceeds various capacities, such as airport arrival capacity.

Estimates of performance metrics can enable tradeoffs between different courses of action.  More specifically, counterfactual estimates of performance due to a given TFMI,  can provide decision makers an estimate of the potential cost of inaction, for example average airborne delays if a GDP had not been imposed at a given arrival airport.  These counterfactual estimates may be useful both at operational and strategic levels when evaluating the cost and benefits of various TFMI at various spatial and temporal scales.  However estimating counterfactual outcomes is methodologically challenging in the ATM context where the notion of random trials or random assignment of flights to  is impractical.  We propose to employ the statistical methodology of causal inference to derive these counterfactual estimates, which have the advantage of being derived from a statistically rigorous framework that has been applied in various other domains, such as health, education, and economics.  To our knowledge, this is the first application of causal inference to ATM.  

In order to make our presentation of Causal Inference, and Propensity Scores concrete, we will use the specific example of estimating counterfactual outcomes due to GDP at JFK in 2014. As noticed in \cite{bilimoria2016analysis}, flights with GDP ground-delays tend to have larger airborne delays than flights that did not receive an EDCT under a GDP\footnote{Roughly four minutes of additional airborne delay was observed for flights into JFK during 2013-2015}.  However it is commonly understood that had those flights under GDP not received a ground-delay, they would experience an even larger airborne delay than actually observed, due to congestion at the arrival airport caused by weather and/or traffic.  In one sense, our present analysis attempts to quantify this potential, yet unobserved, savings in airborne delay.  However, since the counterfactual cannot actually be observed for the ground-delayed flights, we require a statistically sound methodolgy to estimate it from our dataset.  This motivation of performance measurement is of a very specific ATFMI, namely a GDO, but we believe that counterfactual estimation is an important requirement for various other situations relevant for improved ATM.

Although analysis of historical records of ATFMI can in principal demonstrate the relative merits of courses of action and their affect on the observed outcomes, there is a fundamental challenge of accurately accounting for the distinct conditions, such as weather and demand, experienced during previous time periods, and the degree to which differences in outcomes such as delays, the number and severity of safety incidents, etc. are also attributable to these \emph{confounding} conditions.  The general problem of eliminating confounding to accurately attribute the impact any intervention has on observed outcomes is well known and has been studied by statisticians and researchers in various domains \cite{rubin1974estimating}. 

In this report we present a novel application of causal inference, and specifically propensity scores, to reduce or eliminate confounding of differing weather and demand conditions so that one can accurately attribute the impact of potential ATFMI on outcomes such as safety and efficiency.  More specifically, we will apply the confounding reduction methodology of propensity score weighting to statistically estimate counterfactuals for observed ATFMI at airports in the New York metro, and thereby attribute the impact of GDP decisions, one of the available ATFMI, on airborne holding delay, one of the outcomes describing system safety.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
